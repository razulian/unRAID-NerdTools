##

NerdTools is the new plugin that allows you to install additional packages in UnRAID easily.
This project is based on the old NerdPack plugin but has received many improvements and important changes. For example the package installation now takes advantage of the benefits of UnRAID 6.11 and install packages in the path /boot/extra and delegating part of the management to the system itself.
